# Final

## Purpose

This should be a Firebase project, so create your project first and then start coding. I am focusing on the authentication part of Firebase. The data will all be local JSON.

## Instructions

For this final, you will be using Firebase's authentication and adding it to your project. Your final project will be an e-commerce site. You must have a shopping cart, log in and create an account page and show at least 10 coffee machines.

- Your site needs to resemble this site, https://www.keurig.com/c/coffeemakers101?cm_sp=bo+cybermonday21 Links to an external site.
- Nothing else needs to work on the page, but you must have everything on there. ex. navigation, banner, footer etc..
- Your project must have a create account and log-in section. There should be an icon in the top right corner of the page to show the user where to click to log in or create an account. When logged in it should give me the option to log out.
- You must show a cart icon in the top right-hand corner that shows the count of how many coffee makers you have purchased. When clicked on your cart page must show all the coffee makers you have clicked the buy now button on. Your shopping cart page must have an empty cart button that will empty all products.
- Each product must have at least:
  - product image
  - product name
  - product price
  - buy now button
- All of this must look like the site. I would load all the products in a JSON file and load them on the page. This will make adding things to the cart easier.
- Any other data can be stored in JSON that is held in memory, meaning it will not be saved if the page is refreshed.
- If you want to use the local storage built into a browser that would work too.
- You have to make this page responsive.
- Make sure you look at the font and use a similar font.
- You must use the MVC model and view injection to allow for a one-page navigation. Also, use URL navigating.
- You DO NOT have to make any ad pop-ups.
- Your README file should explain your site and why you made it and also have the URL. This will help when you show it later.
- Upload your project to Web 4 and Github and add the Web 4 URL to the Readme file in Github. Then, submit it to this assignment.
